Flexibility to embed bug in other systems sounds great. The described
bug.Close() would be a nice place to implement this feature.

A step towards implementing this would be reconmmending a convention to help
other developers with whatever implementation they choose. For example a file
containing a list of email addresses in each issue directory could be read and
used only for changes to that issue.

This seems like it couild also be implemented together with whatever standard
VCS mechanisms already exist though the Description states implementing it
independently of the VCS.

I don't know about hg or other VCS but a git plugin run during the post-receive
hook exists: git-multimail.py

The recommended implementation of this is a python override of
get_revision_recipients() as described on line 2497 of
https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/hooks/multimail/git_multimail.py

The file post.receive.example has just such python overrides.

If a python implementation is not desired configurable exerimental a feature
multimailhook.refFilterInclusionRegex of git-multimail.py hook. It matches
against complete refnames and could match against just issue path names.

github and other systems built on top of VCS have their own notification
systems.

Given the available workarounds this feels like a lower priority than other
features and may be better handled in a different way. I encourage anyone
interested to try this out.
